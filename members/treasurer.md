  Richard is a junior concentrating in Social Studies because it was the only
  major that wouldnâ€™t flunk him for his outrageous ideas. He is from Fresno, CA
  but somehow harbors a deep-seeded hatred for Fresno State. He served for three
  and a half years in the Army as an Airborne Infantryman, with one deployment
  to Iraq in 2015. He hopes to pursue a music career after graduation, and is
  passionate about being a positive role model in community.
